                        <h2>WHAT</h2>
                        <p>Phone-first parenting is a thoughtful approach where parents delay giving their child a smartphone until they are mature,
                        responsible, and ready to handle the challenges that come with it—usually around ages 13 to 14. Instead of handing out phones
                        at a very young age, this method encourages waiting until children are better equipped to manage social media, peer pressure,
                        and online safety risks.

                        This parenting style involves creating clear family agreements about phone use, such as when and how phones can be used, setting
                        limits on screen time and apps, and teaching children about privacy and respectful behavior online. Parents also model healthy 
                        phone habits themselves by putting devices away during meals or family time.</p>

                        <h3>WHY</h3>
                        <img src="images/secondsection.jpg">
                        <p>In today’s tech-filled world, kids are exposed to screens and smartphones earlier than ever, 
                        which can sometimes harm their mental health, leading to anxiety, sleep problems, and low self-esteem. 
                        Research shows that heavy phone use is linked to increased anxiety and depression in young people.

                        Phone-first parenting offers a way to protect kids by delaying phone ownership, setting clear family rules, 
                        and encouraging open communication. This helps reduce the negative effects of early screen use and strengthens 
                        parent-child relationships—making sure technology supports children’s growth and happiness, not undermines it.</p>

                        <p>Phone-First Parenting means waiting until kids are around 13 or 14 <br>
                        before giving them their first smartphone. Parents set clear rules about <br>
                        when and how phones can be used, teach kids about online safety and privacy,<br>
                        and model healthy phone habits themselves. They also use tools like parental<br>
                        controls to help protect their children. This approach helps kids develop <br>
                        responsible digital habits while keeping family communication strong and ensuring <br>
                        their safety online.</p>
